## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0

#### Breaking Changes
- **LangChain Adapter**: Updated to use `langchain_core.memory.BaseMemory` instead of deprecated `langchain.memory.chat_memory.BaseChatMemory`
  - **Action Required**: Update imports if using LangChain 1.2.10+
  - Old: `from langchain.memory import BaseChatMemory`
  - New: `from langchain_core.memory import BaseMemory`

#### New Features
- All adapters now production-ready with full test coverage
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic in SDKs
- Improved rate limiting with Redis timeouts
- Better documentation and examples

#### Database Migrations
```bash
# Run migrations to update schema
alembic upgrade head
```

#### Configuration Changes
- Added `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` environment variable (default: `true`)
- Added `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS` environment variable (default: `1000`)
- Added `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` environment variable (default: `60`)
